                    Community contributed Python-based tools for working with public bottom trawl surveys data from the NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center Groundfish Assessment Program (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/contact/groundfish-assessment-program">NOAA AFSC GAP</a>). It provides Pythonic access to the official API service with automated pagination, convienent contextual documentation, memory efficient zero catch (absence data) inference, and easy query generation / emulation for data filtering.
